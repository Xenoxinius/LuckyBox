Design a website for a startup

we created a website in 5 days for a fictional start up.
this was created by Imane, Steve, Moeti and Samira.

The startup is called Lucky box. we provide subscription boxes that are fully customisable. we have three main categories: movie themed items, a wide variety of snacks and hobby and stationary items. 

As our customer we give you the power to choose the items yourself to avoid recieving stuff that will end up in the trash eventually.
